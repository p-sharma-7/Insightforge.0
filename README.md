**Introduction**

As we all know, data analysis is something we regularly undertake. Wherever decisions need to be made, we rely on data analysis for better decision-making (data-driven decision-making). In business, we use it frequently, whether it's to gain great insights for targeting the market, making decisions, obtaining predictive insights, tracking performance, and much more. Traditional methods of data analysis often require significant manual effort and expertise, making it difficult for individuals without specialized knowledge to leverage the full potential of their data
To address these challenges, there is a growing demand for customizable and automated data analysis platforms that empower users to perform complex analyses without the need for extensive technical skills. In response to this demand, we present InsightForge.

**Motivation:**

Many individuals and organizations possess valuable data assets but lack the means to extract actionable insights from them effectively. Existing data analysis platforms often require users to possess advanced technical skills in programming and statistics, limiting their accessibility and usability. 
InsightForge aims to bridge this gap by offering a user-friendly interface and a suite of automated analysis capabilities that cater to users with varying levels of expertise. By empowering users to explore and analyse their data in a self-service manner, InsightForge seeks to democratize data analysis and enable organizations to make data-driven decisions more effective.

**Objective:**

1.	Customization: Provide users with the flexibility to customize their analysis workflows to suit their specific requirements and preferences.
2.	Automation: Automate repetitive tasks and analyses to streamline the data analysis process and reduce the burden on users.
3.	Ease of Use: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables users with limited technical expertise to perform complex analyses with ease.
