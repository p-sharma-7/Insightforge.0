## Features

- **No-Code Data Analysis:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and data visualization without writing a single line of code.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive UI designed for users of all technical backgrounds.
- **Automated Insights:** Generate actionable insights and visualizations automatically.
- **Customizable Workflows:** Tailor analysis steps to fit your needs.
- **Data Upload:** Easily upload CSV files for instant analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and plots for deeper data understanding.
- **Prediction Module:** Build and evaluate machine learning models in a few clicks.

## Motivation

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, organizations and individuals often lack the technical skills needed for in-depth data analysis. InsightForge addresses this gap by enabling:

- **Self-service analytics** for non-programmers.
- **Customized and automated workflows** for data exploration and modeling.
- **Simplified data decision-making** with visual insights.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Data:** Import CSV files directly into the app.
2. **Automated EDA:** Instantly receive descriptive statistics, missing value analysis, and data profiling.
3. **Data Visualization:** Explore your data with interactive plots (histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.).
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Select target variables and let the app recommend and train machine learning models.
5. **Download Results:** Export analysis reports and predictions for further use.
